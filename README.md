#Hospital SQL Project
---------------------
>The goal of this project is to create a functioning hospital database including tables to represent required information, inputted data, and examples of queries you can perform.

### Included Documentation: 
1. *Hospital Schema*
2. *Hospital Data*
3. *Hospital Queries*

The Hospital Schema is the foundational file. Without this file, the other two files will not work. This file creates the hospital database, as well as creating 9 tables for the inputted data.

The Hospital Data file was created to be the raw data for the 9 tables. The data used in this project are just examples, but real data can be inputted.

The Hospital Queries file showcases how you can manipulate the system to find specific types of data within the database.
